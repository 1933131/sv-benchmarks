Benchmarks in this directory are from the LDV Project.

The set contains 42 tasks total, used in the LDV project as regression tests for BLAST.  
It consists of small programs that check for features rather than impose a high payload; 
some of these tests are inspired by the patterns they have spotted in the real device drivers code.

All files are preprocessed with CIL, with options "--printCilAsIs --domakeCFG", 
and without option "--dosimplify".
