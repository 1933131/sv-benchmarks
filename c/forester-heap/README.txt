Data structures on heap. Nodes of some data structures contain data
and a correctness of program may depend on a relation between data.
The examples check an ability of tools to use precise but powerful
abstraction or refine abstraction to make abstraction more precise.
Both types of examples are included, correct ones and buggy ones.
