This directory contains verification tasks for checking memory safety.

The property to check is not the reachability of error labels,
but one of the following different aspects of memory safety:
memory leak, invalid free, invalid dereference, invalid use of uninitialized memory,
invalid overlap, unterminated string.

For each property, there will be an own command-line parameter.

The expected verification result should be SAFE and UNSAFE.
