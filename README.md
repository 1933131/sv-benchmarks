# How to Submit Verification Tasks to this Public Repository


##License and Origin
In order to allow others to use your verification tasks, assign a license,
and in order to find out where the software comes from and to assign credits to those that prepared the verification tasks,
add a descripion, perhaps with references to project web sites or published papers.
If you submit a few new files within an existing directory, then you can insert the information
at the beginning of the C file as comment.
If you start a new directory, please add two files LICENSE.txt and README.txt.

##Property.
There should be a file ALL.prp that contains the property to check.
For SV-COMP, the [rules page](http://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/2017/rules.php) explains all currently supported properties:
 - [unreach-call](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sosy-lab/sv-benchmarks/master/c/PropertyERROR.prp)
