Benchmarks in this directory are from the LDV Project.

The directory contains 41 fresh (2011-09), just-from-kernel driver verification tasks.
Among them are 16 "unsafe" tasks, which are accompanied with sample error traces.
Some of these "unsafes" are real bugs reported to kernel developers.

All files are preprocessed with CIL, with options "--printCilAsIs --domakeCFG", 
and without option "--dosimplify".
